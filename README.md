# Employee_django
Deployment of Employee based project using Django, SQLite and HTML (no CSS)

This is my first ever project made using Django!!!
It consists of an employee table which was done using SQLite.
It allows adding new employees and their details such as their name, branch, email-id and salary.
I'll add one more feature of removing the data of an employee/employees.

There is no front-end in this yet, I have to work on it.
But we can add CSS on this using tailwind, it would be quick and better for fast deployment.
